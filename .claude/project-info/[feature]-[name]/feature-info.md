## Agent Notes

When a user provides this prompt, conduct a structured interview:

1. **Interview the user** using `AskQuestion` tool
2. **Focus areas**: Technical implementation, UI/UX, edge cases, concerns, tradeoffs
3. **Go deep** - Skip obvious questions, probe the hard parts they may not have considered
4. **Continue until complete** - Don't stop early; cover all aspects thoroughly
5. **Output**: Write final spec to `SPEC.md`

### Example User Prompt

> I want to build [brief description]. Interview me about it, then write a spec.
